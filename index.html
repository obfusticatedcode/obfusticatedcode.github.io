								<h2>I enjoy solving problems through code</h2>
								<p>
                  I’ve always had a fascination for computers. My first job was building and
                  fixing hardware and software problems in a computer repair shop. <br>
                  This naturally lead to my profound appreciation for software and has drawn me to write code, trying to instruct the computer.

                  I am looking for an environment to continue learning and growing.

                  I used AngularJS on the front end and Ruby on Rails in the backend.
                  PostgreSQL was a great fit to create models and relationships.
                  To secure the app, I used oauth from Facebook, Github and Instagram to allow the UX to be easy and quick.
                  For image upload and storage I used AWS and Carrierwave.

								<p>Disaster relief is designed to allow people affected by a natural disaster to ask for help.
                  It also allows other users to give help. The idea came from the apparent lack of apps in this space.<br>
                  Working in a team, I was the Git master and was responsible setting up the oauth and RESTful routes.
                  We used Node.js to build the fully CRUD/RESTful Express.js app.
                  This project allowed me to get a good handle on AngularJS; used Google Maps API as directives.

								<p>Trade Space is a free online ad space for trading, linked with what3words.
                  Individual and local buying and selling aided by a simple way to talk about location for the 75% of countries without formal addresses.
                  This fully RESTful, Express.js app was built with the aim of helping people mostly in third world countries have access to a trading space online; as most don’t have a formal address. <br>
                  Using Mongoose ORM with MongoDB for storing data in a flexible way and Heroku for deployment.
                  To secure the app I used, oauth from Facebook and Instagram as well as traditional JWT.
                  what3words API was used for solving the problem of users with no formal addresses.
                  For this I used AJAX to make the request.</p>

                <p>
                  As my first project, I created a web-based checkers game.
                  Allowing players to play by selecting pieces and clicking on the square they want to move to.
                  Growing up, my mum loved playing checkers and that’s where my inspiration came from.
                  I used JS and jQuery extensively to solve the complexity of the game logic.
                  Gulp was very useful for enhancing the workflow by automating tasks like running the development server.

									<h3>Mastery by Robert Greene</h3>
									<p>
                    I enjoy listening to audiobooks on my train commutes and ‘Mastery’, has changed how I see being great at something; no matter what it is.
                    The book has allowed me to have a deep appreciation for the apprenticeship phase where <br>
                    I can practice the craft (web development) to get the 10, 000 hours which roughly translates to 7-10 years of hands on experience.
